        Another one, great, wonder if those twelve spirit stones are worth it... <br>
        Fine, listen up carefully, I won't repeat myself. Even though your daoist title should express thyself fully, there may be others who share your disposition.
        Thus, every 90 nights, the sect will graciously allow you to choose a new name to be bestowed with.
        <br> Shaping the image of your divine will is not needed, although encouraged. After all, reputation can shake
        oceans and move mountains. At worst, the sect shall grant your will a worthy image. In either case, it can be
        changed at a later date.<br>
        Of course, your daoist title and divine will shape will be seen and judged by others. Your true name though,
        that shall remain a secret, lest a demonic expert casts a bloodline or soul curse on you. <br>
        After joining, your immortal cave will still be closed. You need to get a jade slip from the Outer Court Elder,
        Zhao Jiang first. If he forgets to give it to you, don't hesitate to remind him. Respectfully of course. He
        tends to spend his days in Troubled pavilion, hidden under the Settings abode.<br>
        Accepting the rules of the sect is something I hope I don't need to remind you of. You can find a copy of them on
        those jade slips: <a href="https://www.privacypolicies.com/blog/sample-terms-service-template/">first jade
        slip</a>, <a href="https://www.privacypolicies.com/blog/sample-terms-service-template/">second jade
        slip</a>. I doubt you'd find them of particular interest though.<br>
        You could, I guess, also use the decree of the hegemon of the righteous path, the Google Sect to join. If you
        follow this lead, a part of the their token will be unveiled to our sect's higher-ups. An insignificant part,
        mind you.
        A minor warning, junior, the side effect of using such a decree is forcibly accepting a rather unsightly daoist
        title and a divine will shape as common as a grey pebble by a roadside. Nothing that cannot be changed later
        at least.
        Oh, it nearly slipped my mind, using the decree once means having your soul bound to it. Separating those two
        lies beyond the capabilities of the likes of me. And I doubt you'd have anything that would move the hearts of
        the Elders, convincing them to lend a hand. Oh, their single breath worth more than a decade of your bitterness...<br>
        After you join, the sect will keep a few drops of your blood in the Grand Formation. If not for it, you'd be crushed
        to death like an ant by its power, treated akin to a guest, without any ties of karma.<br>
        As for other things you own, who'd like to store such useless stuff anyway? Now, carry on, don't bother me any
        longer, my tea is growing cold.<br><br>
