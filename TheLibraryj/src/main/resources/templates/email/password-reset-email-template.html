<p>Greetings disciple..., ah, I've forgotten, just as you seem to have forgotten your cave entry code.</p>
<p>
    Your request for a new one has reached me recently. <br/>
    Very well then, this senior will help you one more time. Although, I do look down on those wasting my time, junior!<br/>
    Bellow you shall find a dark blue formation array. Interacting with it will let you reset the entry code to your Immortal Cave.
    <br/>
    <a th:href="@{${password_reset_link}}">Reset my entry code.</a> <br/>
    Be prudent junior for the formation array will run out of energy in about <span th:text="${expires_at}">Expiration time lost in transmission</span> <br/>
    If it were not you who request the entry code change, ignore this reply. <br/> Beware of the demonic scoundrels, trying to bewitch us, righteous cultivators, on every step!
</p>
<p>
    May this be the last time this happens, junior! <br/>
